# DRP Owner Offer Suite (compact) — simple upload

## What to do
1) Open this folder.
2) Upload *everything* inside to your GitHub repo (keep the `owners-onboarding-compact-v2_9/` name if you can).
3) Turn on Pages (main branch / root). Open `index.html`.

That’s it. No extra setup.

## Notes you might want later
- If you want to change baseline ADR/occupancy, edit the numbers in `assets/baselines.js` (they’re right at the top).
- Lease Unfurnished: uncheck “Amortize” if the owner furnishes so you don’t finance furniture.
- All calculations are self‑contained (no internet fetch). Works from your computer (double‑click) and on GitHub Pages.
